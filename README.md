# Demo Day Project

This the bare bones of my Demo Day project, which is a social media site for artists. Users will be able to add each other, browse an explore page, and upload art that they've made.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

Right now, there is mostly just HTML and CSS, just as a light wireframe for the project. Later on, updates will be made to include Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. 

## Thoughts:

Routes are going to be a nightmare in here. This is my first time working with so many pages. Project feels a bit daunting...but it's definitely fun. I'm really excited so far to make something that I've been wanting to see for a while. A lot of art sites have been dying, and there's only a handful that still remain popular (in my opinion).
